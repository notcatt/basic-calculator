# 🧮 Basic Calculator 
<ul>
  <li>A cientific calculator (w/ Python & PySide6)</li>
</ul>

# 👨🏻‍💻 Getting started 

<ul> 
<li>This program was developed on the Linux operating system. Therefore, it may generate errors in the Windows operating system, or Mac too;</li>
<li>Python version 3.11.7 was used;</li>
<li>And for the GUI the PySide6 library;</li>  
<li>The application supports the following operators (+-/^) in addition to negative numbers.</li>
<li>Several shortcuts were also implemented to perform operations in the application (For example, clicking the DELETE key clears the calculator display);</li>
<li>A functionality was also implemented where it is only possible to add numbers, thus reducing the possibility of vulnerabilities for the user.</li>  
</ul>
